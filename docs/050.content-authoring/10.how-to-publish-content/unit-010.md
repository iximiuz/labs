While publication via a direct link is always possible,
the iximiuz Labs team reserves the right to choose which content will be listed in the Community and Independent Authors catalogs.

**Setting `canList` to `["anyone"]` is treated only as an indicator of the author's willingness to list the content in one of the platform's catalogs.**
