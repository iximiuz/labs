# iximiuz Labs

This is a multi-purpose repository behind the [iximiuz Labs](https://labs.iximiuz.com/) interactive learning platform.
The repository contains a collection of open-source materials related to the platform and also serves as a bug- and feature request tracker (via [issues](/../../issues)).

The repository currently includes:

- [Content samples](content-samples/) - self-documenting samples of Tutorials, Challenges, and Skill Paths (for people interested in publishing their own content on the platform)
- [Documentation](docs/) - documentation for the platform (what is iximiuz Labs, how to get started, how to learn on the platform, how to use existing and create your own playgrounds, etc.)
- [Playgrounds](playgrounds/) - collection of rootfs images for the playground virtual machines (for people interested in creating their own playgrounds)
